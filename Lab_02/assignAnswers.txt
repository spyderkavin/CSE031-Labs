Assignmennt 1
1. What is the bug here?
The sum used to compute the average in main was incorrect because read_values received sum by value (a copy), so updates inside read_values did not update main's sum.

2. How do you fix it?
Pass sum by pointer. Change read_values(double sum) to read_values(double *sum), update writes to *sum inside the function, and call it as read_values(&sum) from main. Also ensure scanf uses &input when reading integers.

Assignment 2
1. Run the program with input str1="HELLO!" and str2="hello!". Is the output expected?
Yes. The output is HELLO!hello!, which matches the expected append result.

2. Without stopping, enter str1="HI!" and str2="hi!". Is the output expected? What is the bug? How do you fix it?
Before fixing, the output is not reliable because append had a null-terminator bug ("\0" used as a string literal/pointer instead of a character terminator). The fix is to set the terminator as a character after the loop: s1[s1len + s2len] = '\0';.

3. Without stopping, enter str1="Hello! How are you?" and str2="I am fine, thank you!". Is the output expected? Why?
No. This happens because str1 and str2 are only 10 bytes each, so those long inputs overflow the buffers and cause undefined behavior (corrupted output/possible crash).
